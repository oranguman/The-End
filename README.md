To build the book, you will need to have LaTeX installed.  If you're lucky and your operating system has a package manager that supports LaTeX, then use the package manager; it will be the easiest way to go.  Alternatively, you can go to the <a href="http://tug.org/">TeX Users Group (TUG)</a> website and download and install the software most appropriate for your machine.  

Once you have LaTeX installed, change directories into the `The-End` directory, and run `latexmk --pdf book.tex`.  That should create a new PDF file titled `book.pdf`.  Read and enjoy!
